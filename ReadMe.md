Redactr is one of the holiday challenges from Altschool. It is basically a tool for scrambling specific words you do not want people too see in a body of text.
The app comes with 2 text input fields for the user. One of those fields receives the word/words the user wants to scramble while the other receives the full body of text to be redacted.
Redactr allows the user to choose one of 4 symbols as the scrambler; you can replace the word/words to be scrambled with an asterisk(*), question mark(?), hyphen(-), and underscore(_).
The app has a 3rd text input field. However, this field is readonly, and it displays the fully redacted text.
Redactr has 2 buttons: Redact and Clear. Redact initiates the redaction while Clear returns all text fields to default.
