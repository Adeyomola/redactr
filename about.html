        Redactr is basically a tool for scrambling words in a body of text. On the homepage,
        when you click on the Redact Your Text button, it will take you to the redaction page.<br>
        <br>
        On the redaction, you will come across 3 fields and 2 buttons: <br>
        &#8226; The first field takes the word/words you want to redact. However, if you are redacting more than one
        word,
        you should leave a space between each word. <br>
        &#8226; The second field takes the character you want in place of the words you want to redact. You should enter
        just a single character in this field <br>
        &#8226; The third field is where the body of text you want to redact goes. <br>
        <br>
        After filling all 3 fields, click on the Redact Now button to redact your text. On clicking on this button, you
        will be redirected to a page with your redacted text. <br>
        On this new page, you will come across 1 field, 3 buttons, and a summary of the redaction process: <br>
        &#8226; The field shows your redacted text. <br>
        &#8226; The first button is a copy button - for copying the redacted text.<br>
        &#8226; The second button deletes the content of the field.<br>
        &#8226; The third button takes you back to the redaction page.<br>
